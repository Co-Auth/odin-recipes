            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can fat-free refried beans</li>
            <li>⅓ cup salsa</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

    </p2>
    <h3>Steps to Perfection</h3>
    <p3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water, salt, oil, flour and yeast to your bread machine in the order listed. 
                Select the dough cycle. Check your dough after it has been mixing a few minutes. If it is too dry and not mixing, 
                add water 1 tablespoon at a time, until it is mixing and has a nice dough consistency. You want the dough to be pliable but not sticky.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine tomato paste, water, and 3/4 of the package of taco seasoning mix. Stir in chili powder and cayenne pepper; set aside. In another bowl, mix refried beans, salsa, and onion; set aside. 
                In a large skillet, cook ground beef until evenly brown; drain excess fat. 
                Season with the remaining 1/4 package of taco seasoning and a small amount of water. Simmer a few minutes, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
            <li>When the dough cycle is finished, remove the dough from the machine. 
                Divide the dough in half, and pat into two 12 inch pans. 
                Spread a layer of the bean mixture on, then a layer of the tomato mixture. 
                Sprinkle with seasoned beef and top with cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. Turn pizzas halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
